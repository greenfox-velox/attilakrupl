                <p>Margaret Heafield was born to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (née Partington).<sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[4]</a></sup> She graduated from Hancock High School in 1954, and earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from <a href="" class="content-link1">Earlham College</a> in 1958.<sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[5]</a></sup> After graduation, she briefly taught high school mathematics and French in order to support her husband while he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard, but with the ultimate goal of pursuing a graduate degree at a later time.
                She moved to <a href="" class="content-link1">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, with the intention of doing graduate study in <a href="" class="content-link1">abstract mathematics</a> at <a href="" class="content-link1">Brandeis University</a>.
                In 1960 she took an interim position at <a href="" class="content-link1">MIT</a> to develop software for predicting weather on the <a href="" class="content-link1">LGP-30</a> and the <a href="" class="content-link1">PDP-1</a> computers (at <a href="" class="content-link1">Marvin Minsky's</a> <a href="" class="content-link1">Project MAC</a>) for professor

                <p>From 1961 to 1963, she worked on the <a href="" class="content-link1">SAGE Project</a> at <a href="" class="content-link1">Lincoln Labs</a>, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first <a href="" class="content-link1">AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1)</a>, to search for "unfriendly" aircraft; she also wrote software for the <a href="" class="content-link1">Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories</a>.</p>

                    <div>
                    <p>In one of the critical moments of the <a href="" class="content-link1">Apollo 11</a> mission, Hamilton's team's work and <a href="" class="content-link1">J. Halcombe Laning</a>'s operating system design,<sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[10]</a></sup> in the <a href="" class="content-link1">Apollo Guidance Computer software</a> prevented an abort of landing on the moon.
                    <sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[11]</a></sup> Three minutes before the <a href="" class="content-link1">Lunar lander</a> reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. The computer was overloaded with incoming data, because the <a href="" class="content-link1">rendezvous</a>
                    <a href="" class="content-link1">radar system</a> (not necessary for landing) updated an involuntary counter in the computer, which <a href="" class="content-link1">stole cycles</a> from the computer. Due to its <a href="" class="content-link1">robust architecture</a>, the computer was able to keep running; the Apollo onboard flight software was developed using an asynchronous executive so that higher priority jobs (important for landing) could interrupt lower priority jobs.<sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[11]</a></sup> The fault was attributed to a faulty checklist.</p>
                    <p class="indented-par">Due to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, <span class="it-sp">I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks</span>; i.e., the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.</p>

                  <p>Hamilton popularized the term <a href="" class="content-link1">"software engineering"</a>,<sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[20]</a></sup> coined first by Anthony Oettinger.<sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[21]</a></sup><sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[22]</a></sup> Software engineering, at the time, was not taken as seriously compared to other engineering, it was not regarded as a science. She used the term "software engineering" to distinguish the difference between hardware engineering.
                  Over time the term "software engineering" has gained the respect as any other discipline.<sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[23]</a></sup> "At MIT she assisted in the creation of the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer".<sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[24]</a></sup> In this field she pioneered the concepts of asynchronous software, priority scheduling, end-to-end testing, and man-in-the-loop decision capability, such as priority displays which then became the foundation for ultra reliable software design.<sup><a class="content-link1" href="101">[citation needed]</a></sup>
                  Margaret's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important role in getting man to the moon.
