To deploy, please clone the repository.

Run server.js from terminal: nodemon server.js

Access the app from Google Chrome: http://localhost:3000

Comments:

I've added a server, so the app is accessing the .json file through that. This way it is just a step away from connecting to a database.

The Add and Graph panels are reacting to the Esc button. Both panels can't be opened at the same time.

The text input fields of the Add panel have to be filled up, the panel doesn't close when clicking OK without data, instead it alerts user.

Graph panel doesn't handle dynamic data. It only displays a static data selection at the moment due to lack of time.

Many Thanks!
